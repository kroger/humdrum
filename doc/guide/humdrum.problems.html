<H1>HUMDRUM PROBLEMS</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>This document describes some known problems with the Humdrum Toolkit.</B>
</CENTER>
</P>

<H2>Version Differences</H2>
<blockquote>
<P>
The Humdrum Toolkit has undergone continuous revision
and augmentation since 1989.
Each version of the Toolkit is identified by a version number.
</P>
<P>
If you have installed the Humdrum Toolkit,
you can determine which version you are using by typing
the <b>humver</b> command.
</P>
</blockquote>
<H2>Official and Unofficial Versions</H2>
<blockquote>
<P>
Several versions of the Humdrum Toolkit exist,
both <i>official releases</i> and <i>unofficial versions</i>.
</P>
<P>
In creating each <i>Official Release</i> of the Humdrum Toolkit,
I have maintained a policy that we
release only software that has been
tested on multiple operating systems.
Test systems have included AIX,
BSD Unix,
HPUX,
Linux,
Solaris
and DOS/MKS Toolkit.
</P>
<P>
Although software development is ongoing,
we tend to revise and develop the software on a single operating system (mostly Linux).
Since operating systems differ slightly, it is not always clear
that new or revised software will work properly on other systems.
We realize that testing on other systems is essential;
in particular, we try to be careful to avoid introducing new bugs when
fixing old ones.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, running test suites on the various operating systems
is cumbersome and time-consuming, and no one has volunteered
to help with this.
Consequently, running test suites relies on external grants to hire
a programmer.
The last time such funds were available was 1994.
</P>
<P>
This explains why the most current version of the Humdrum Toolkit is 2.6
whereas the currently <i>available official release</i> is 1.0.
</P>
</blockquote>
<H2>Differences Between Humdrum Release 1.0 and Versions 2.X</H2>
<blockquote>
<H4>Documentation</H4>
<blockquote>
<P>
Please note that much of the Humdrum Toolkit documentation
(including the
<i>Humdrum Users Guide</i>)
describes Humdrum version 2.0 or beyond.
In some cases, the documentation describes how the tools
<i>ought</i> to function rather than how they <i>actually</i>
function.
For example, the <b>yank</b> command does not yet handle
the system of <i>nested section labels</i> described in the
<i>Humdrum Users Guide</i>.
</P>
</blockquote>
<H4>The "ditto" and "fill" Commands</H4>
<blockquote>
<P>
The old Humdrum <b>fill</b> command was renamed
<b>ditto</b> with Version 2.0.
</P>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<H2>Reporting Bugs</H2>
<blockquote>
<P>
Please do not report software bugs until further notice.
I have a list of known bugs, and most users simply
tell me what I already know.
Unfortunately, I can no longer handle the volume of e-mail
that I receive related to Humdrum.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a good solution would be to post the known bugs on
the web, so users could refer to the list before submitting
a bug report.
However, I don't currently have the time to do this.
Sorry.
