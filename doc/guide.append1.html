Reference records are formal ways of encoding "library-type"
information pertaining to a Humdrum document.
Reference records provide standardized ways of
encoding bibliographic information
--  suitable for computer-based access.
</P>
<P>
A perpetual problem with reference information pertains to the
language in which information is represented.
Humdrum provides comprehensive methods for dealing with
multiple languages.
These methods are described below, and Humdrum
users are encouraged to become familiar with these
conventions.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum reference records are designated by three exclamation marks at
the beginning of a line, followed by a multi-letter code,
followed by an optional number, followed by a colon, followed by some text.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 reference codes are pre-defined in Humdrum.
Each of these reference records is described below under eight
categories:
(1) <A HREF="#Authorship_Information">authorship information,</A>
(2) <A HREF="#Performance_Information">performance information,</A>
(3) <A HREF="#Identification_Information">work identification information,</A>
(4) <A HREF="#Imprint_Information">imprint information,</A>
(5) <A HREF="#Copyright_Information">copyright information,</A>
(6) <A HREF="#Analytic_Information">analytic information,</A>
(7) <A HREF="#Historical_Information">historical information,</A> and
(8) <A HREF="#Representation_Information">representation information.</A>
A final section discusses <A HREF="#Electronic_Citation">how to cite electronic documents.</A>
</P>
<A NAME="Language">
<H2>Accommodating Different Languages</H2>
<P>
Humdrum attempts to accommodate all languages.
Reference information can be encoded using the original language
of the source material or document.
In addition, reference information can be encoded in
various translations that help end users.
Humdrum uses the
<A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html">
<B>International Standards Organization ISO 639-2</B></A>
standard for representing languages.
This standard provides 3-letter codes for more than 4,000
existing and historical languages.
For example, the ISO standard codes for English, French and Swahili are
<code><big>
eng
</code></big>
<code><big>
fre
</code></big>
and
<code><big>
swa
</code></big>
respectively.
(A table of 50 common languages is given at the end of this appendix.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Humdrum allows any type of reference information to be encoded
in any or all of these languages.
In general, the <i>primary</i> reference information is encoded using
the original language of the source material.
Consider the case of a Friuli folksong
(Friuli is a dialect of Italian).
The title of the song should be encoded in the original
language, but it may also be useful to provide
translations in Italian and English.
</P>
<P>
The principal reference code indicating title is
<code><big>
!!!OTL:
</code></big>
(see below).
Following the OTL reference code, the language of encoding
can be indicated by appending an "at" sign (@),
followed by the 3-letter ISO language code.
Here the title is rendered in three languages:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!OTL@@FUR: Ai preit la biele stele
<br>
!!!OTL@ITA: Ho pregato la buona stella
<br>
!!!OTL@ENG: The Good Star
</code></big>
</blockquote>
Notice the use of the double "at" sign (i.e., "@@").
This convention is used to indicate that Friuli is
the primary reference language.
The title can also be encoded without any language
designation:
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!OTL: Ai preit la biele stele
</code></big>
</blockquote>
This implies that the title is already rendered in the <i>primary</i>
reference language.
</P>

<A NAME="Authorship_Information">
<A NAME="composer">
<A NAME="COM">
<H2>Authorship Information</H2>
</P>
<P>
<b>!!!COM:</b>
<A HREF="guide03.html#Searching_for_Reference_Information">
<B>Composer's name</B></A>.
In some cases, opinions differ regarding the best spelling of a composer's name.
If so, all common spellings should be given -- each alternative
separated from the previous by a semicolon.
E.g.
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!COM: Chopin, Fryderyk; Chopin, Frederick
</code></big>
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
With respect to accents, refer to the discussion concerning
the <b>!!!RLN:</b> reference record (<A HREF="#RLN">see below</A>).
If a work was composed by more than one composer,
then each composer's name should appear on a separate <b>!!!COM:</b> record
with a number designation prior to the colon.
For example,
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!COM1: Composer, A.
<br>
!!!COM2: Composer, B.
</code></big>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="attributed composer">
<A NAME="COA">
<P>
<b>!!!COA:</b>
<i>Attributed composer</i>.
This may include attributions known to be false.
Several attributions may be combined on a single record by separating
each name by a semicolon.
Note that if a document contains both <b>!!!COA:</b> and <b>!!!COM:</b>
records, then the attributed composer is explicitly assumed to be false.
</P>
<A NAME="suspected composer">
<A NAME="COS">
<P>
<b>!!!COS:</b>
<i>Suspected composer</i>.
This reference code indicates the belief of the editor or producer
of the document as to the true identity of the composer(s).
If more than one composer is suspected, each name should appear
on a separate <b>!!!COS:</b> record with a number
designation prior to the colon.
</P>
<A NAME="composer's alias">
<A NAME="stage name">
<A NAME="COL">
<P>
<b>!!!COL:</b>
<i>Composer's abbreviated, alias, or stage name</i>.
e.g. Madonna.
</P>
<A NAME="corporate name, composer">
<A NAME="composer's corporate name">
<A NAME="COC">
<P>
<b>!!!COC:</b>
<i>Composer(s) corporate name</i>.
Corporate names may include the names of popular groups
(especially when the actual composer is not known).
Corporate names may also include business names,
e.g. Muzak.
</P>
<A NAME="composer's dates">
<A NAME="birthdate, composer">
<A NAME="death date, composer">
<A NAME="CDT">
<P>
<b>!!!CDT:</b>
<i>Composer's dates</i>.
The birth and death dates should be encoded using the
<A HREF="representations/Zeit.rep.html">
<code><big>**Zeit</big></code></A>
format described in the <i>Humdrum Reference Manual</i>.
The <code><big>**Zeit</big></code> format provides a highly refined representation,
including methods for representing uncertainty, approximation,
and boundary dates (e.g. prior to ..., after ...).
</P>
<A NAME="composer nationality">
<A NAME="CNT">
<P>
<b>!!!CNT:</b>
<i>Nationality of the composer</i>.
This reference information is encoded using the language of the nationality.
Thus a German composer is encoded as <code><big>Deutscher</big></code> rather
than "German", and a French composer is encoded as
<code><big>Francais</big></code> rather than "French."
Of course the specific language can be explicitly encoded using
the 3-letter language codes described above.
(e.g., <code>!!!CNT@@FRE: Francais</code>).
Where the composer changed nationality, successive nationalities
should be listed (in chronological order) separated by semicolons.
</P>
<A NAME="lyricist">
<A NAME="LYR">
<P>
<b>!!!LYR:</b>
<i>Lyricist</i>.
The name of the lyricist.
If more than one lyricist was involved in the work,
then each lyricist's name should appear on a separate <b>!!!LYR:</b> record
with a number designation prior to the colon.
If the composer was also the lyricist, this should be explicitly
encoding using the independent <b>!!!LYR:</b> record --
rather than implicitly assumed.
</P>
<A NAME="librettist">
<A NAME="LIB">
<P>
<b>!!!LIB:</b>
<i>Librettist</i>.
The name of the librettist.
If more than one librettist was involved in the work,
then each librettist's name should appear on a separate <b>!!!LIB:</b> record
with a number designation prior to the colon.
If the composer was also the librettist, this should be explicitly
encoding using the independent <b>!!!LIB:</b> record --
rather than implicitly assumed.
</P>
<A NAME="arranger">
<A NAME="LAR">
<P>
<b>!!!LAR:</b>
<i>Arranger</i>.
The name of the arranger.
If more than one arranger was involved in the work,

with a number designation prior to the colon.
</P>
<A NAME="orchestrator">
<A NAME="LOR">
<P>
<b>!!!LOR:</b>
<i>Orchestrator</i>.

then each orchestrator's name should appear on a separate <b>!!!LOR:</b> record
with a number designation prior to the colon.
</P>
<A NAME="original language">
<A NAME="TXO">
<P>
<b>!!!TXO:</b>
<i>Original language of vocal/choral text</i>.
The name of the language should be encoded in that language.
For example, <code><big>russki</big></code> rather than <code><big>Russian</big></code>.
</P>
<A NAME="encoded language">
<A NAME="TXL">
<P>
<b>!!!TXL:</b>
<i>Language of the
<b>encoded</b>
vocal/choral text</i>.
The name of the language should be encoded in the language
used for encoding.
For example, <code><big>Italiano</big></code> rather than <code><big>Italian</big></code>.
</P>
<A NAME="translator">
<A NAME="TRN">
<P>
<b>!!!TRN:</b>
<i>Translator of text</i>.
The name of the translator of any vocal, choral, or dramatic text.
If more than one translator was involved in the work,
then each translator's name should appear on a separate <b>!!!TRN:</b> record
with a number designation prior to the colon.
</P>
<A NAME="Performance_Information">
<H2>Performance Information</H2>
</P>
<P>
Humdrum representations may encode performance-activity information
rather than (or in addition to) score-related information.
If the representation encodes a given performance
(such as a MIDI performance),
then the following reference records may be pertinent.
</P>
<A NAME="performer">
<A NAME="MPN">
<P>
<b>!!!MPN:</b>
<i>Performer's name</i>.

<b>!!!EST:</b>
<i>Encoding status</i>.
This record indicates the current status of the document as it is
being produced.
Free-format text may indicate that the encoding is in-progress,
list tasks remaining, or indicate that the encoding is complete.
<b>!!!EST:</b> records are normally eliminated prior to
distribution of the document.
</P>
<A NAME="VTS">
<A NAME="checksum validation number">
<P>
<b>!!!VTS:</b>
<i>Checksum validation number</i>.
This reference encodes the checksum number for the file -- excluding
the <b>!!!VTS:</b> record itself.
When this record is eliminated from the file,
any POSIX.2 standard
<b>cksum</b>
command can be used to determine whether the file originates
with the publisher, or whether it has been modified in some way.
(See the Humdrum
<b>veritas</b>
command described in Section 4.)
Note that this validation process is easily circumvented by
malicious individuals.
For true security, the checksum value should be compared
with a printed list of checksums provided by the electronic publisher.

<P>
<b>!!!AIN:</b>
<A HREF="guide.append2.html"><B>Instrumentation.</B></A>
This reference is used to list all of the instruments (including voice)
used in the work.
Instruments should be encoded using the abbreviations specified
by the <code><big>*I</big></code> tandem interpretation described in
Appendix II.
Instrument codes must appear in alphabetical order separated by spaces.
(Note that alphabetical ordering is essential in order to facilitate
searches for specific combinations or subsets of instruments
using the
<b>grep</b>
command.)
E.g. 
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!AIN: clars corno fagot flt oboe

</P>
<A NAME="ARE">
<A NAME="region designation">
<P>
<b>!!!ARE:</b>
<i>Geographical region of origin</i>.
This reference identifies the geographical location
from which the work originates.
Location designations are encoded using the local language.
The location begins with the continent designation,
and becomes successively more refined.
If the information is available, refinement can continue
to suburban district or even street address.
<P>
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!ARE: Europa, Mitteleuropa, Deutschland, Wuerttemberg, Sindelfingen
<br>
!!!ARE: America, North America, United States of America, Ohio, Columbus

</P>
<A NAME="ARL">
<A NAME="location designation">
<P>
<b>!!!ARL:</b>
<i>Geographical location of origin</i>.
Like the ARE record, this reference record
identifies the geographical location
from which a work originates.
Location designations are encoded using latitude
and longitude values -- suitable for creating maps.
The first numerical value indicates latitude (positive
values indicating North, negative values indicating South).
The second numerical value indicates longitude (positive
values only, indicating distance East from the central
meridian).
A slash separates the latitude and longitude values.
A series of trailing characters is used to indicate
the degree of accuracy of the location information:
% (continent), @ (country), # (province or state),
: (town or village).
For large regions such as countries or provinces,
the geographical center of the region is used.

<b>!!!HAO:</b>
<i>Aural History</i>.
This is a free-form text record used to relay
any story or stories about the origin, purpose
or background of the work.
This reference record is especially useful in
ethnomusicological materials, where a particular
story accompanies a song.
The story may be encoded using several successive HAO records.
</P>
<A NAME="HTX">
<A NAME="text_translation">
<P>
<b>!!!HTX:</b>
<i>Free-form Translation of Vocal Text</i>.
This is a free-form text record used to relay
a non-literal translation of a vocal text.

<b>!!!RLN:</b>
<i>ASCII language setting</i>.
This reference identifies the "language" code in which
the file was encoded.
This is applicable only to computer platforms which provide
"extended ASCII" text capabilities (e.g. Danish or Spanish characters).
</P>
<A NAME="User-defined signifiers">
<A NAME="RDF">
<P>
<b>!!!RDF:</b>
<i>User-defined signifiers</i>.
All Humdrum representations provide some signifiers (ASCII characters) that
remain undefined.
Users are free to use these undefined signifiers as they choose.
When undefined signifiers appear in a given document,
the <b>!!!RDF:</b> code should
be used to specify what the signifiers denote.
E.g.
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
<code><big>
!!!RDF1: X=hands cross, left over right
<br>
!!!RDF2: x=hands cross, right over left
</code></big>
</blockquote>
</P>

concerning the encoded material.
</P>
<A NAME="Electronic_Citation">
<H2>Electronic Citation</H2>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electronic editions of music might be cited in printed or other documents
by including the following information.
The "author" (e.g. <A HREF="#composer"><b>!!!COM:</b></A>),
the "title" -- either original title
(<A HREF="#OTL"><b>!!!OTL:</b></A>)
or translated title (e.g. <A HREF="#XEN"><b>!!!XEN:</b></A>).
The editor (<A HREF="#electronic editor"><b>!!!EED:</b></A>),
publisher (<A HREF="#publisher of electronic edition"><b>!!!YEP:</b></A>),
date of publication and copyright owner
(<A HREF="#date and owner of electronic copyright"><b>!!!YEC:</b></A>),
and electronic version
(<A HREF="#electronic edition version"><b>!!!EEV:</b></A>),
In addition, a full citation ought to include the validation
checksum (<A HREF="#checksum validation number"><b>!!!VTS:</b></A>).
This number will allow others to verify that a particular electronic
document is precisely the one cited.
A sample electronic citation might be:
</P>
<P>
<blockquote>
Franz Liszt, Hungarian Rhapsody No. 8 in F-sharp minor (solo piano).
<br>
Amsterdam: Rijkaard Software Publishers, 1994;
H. Vo\o'r\(hc'i\o's\(hc'ek (Ed.),
<br>
Electronic edition version 2.1, checksum 891678772.
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
In Humdrum files it does not matter where reference records appear.
Since it is common for users to inspect the beginning of a file in order
to check whether the file is being properly processed, the number of
reference records at the beginning of the file should be kept to a
minimum.
A good habit is to place the composer, title of the work, and
copyright records at the beginning of the file, and to relegate
all other reference records to the end of the file.
