<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>
This document provides a detailed description
of how to translate score-related data from the MuseData format
to the Humdrum format.
Some familiarity with Humdrum and MuseData is assumed.
A suitable introduction to the MuseData format may be found in
<A HREF="manual.bibliog.html"><b>
W.B. Hewlett,
"MuseData: Comprehensive representation for printing, sound,
and analysis."</b></A>
In: E. Selfridge-Field
<i>Beyond MIDI: The Handbook of Musical Codes,</i>
Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1997.
A suitable introduction to Humdrum may be found in
Section I ("Humdrum General Introduction") of the
<i>Humdrum Toolkit Reference Manual</i>
(pp. 7-37).
In addition, the user must be familiar with the Humdrum Kern
representation.
The most comprehensive introduction to Kern is in the file
<code>kern_rep.txt</code> found in every distribution disk
containing Kern data.
Additional technical details regarding Kern are given in the
<i>Humdrum Toolkit Reference Manual,</i>
pp. 96-105.
</P>
<P>
Both
<i>MuseData</i>
and
<i>Humdrum</i>
are used to represent score-related musical data.
MuseData provides a hub of high quality data that may be
translated to various forms -- one of which is Humdrum.
Humdrum representations are tailored to facilitate music analysis.
The goal of translation is to provide
a broader distribution of CCARH data for music scholars.
It is important that the translation be as accurate and
complete as possible.
</P>
<P>
When translating between two formats, it's important to know
some things about both representations.
Both MuseData and Humdrum rely on ASCII (text) formats.
Descriptions of the MuseData and Humdrum "Kern" representations
may be found in E. Selfridge-Field (editor)
<i>Handbook of Musical Codes</i>
(MIT Press, 1997).
The MuseData representation is also described in documents
available from the Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities;
a succinct description of the Humdrum "Kern" representation
can also be found in the file <code>kern_hlp.txt</code> which accompanies
every Humdrum data distribution.
</P>
<P>
There are two types of MuseData files:
<i>stage 1</i>
and
<i>stage 2.</i>
Both stages conform to the MuseData representation format,
but stage 2 data is more complete.
Specifically, stage 2 data includes layout information
suitable for printing and notation display.
For example, stage 2 data contains stem direction information
which is not present in stage 1.
Translation to Humdrum can be done from
<i>either</i>
stage 1 or stage 2 MuseData -- however, it is obviously preferable
to translate from the more complete stage 2 data.
</P>
<P>
Humdrum provides several different types of representations.
In translating MuseData, the most pertinent Humdrum representations are the
<i>Kern</i>
and
<i>Bnum</i>
representations.
The
<i>Kern</i>
representation is suitable for representing notes, rests, stems,
beams, etc., and is the most important of the Humdrum target representations.
The
<i>Bnum</i>
representation is used to represent "basso numerato"
or figured-bass data.
Figured bass information may or may not be present in the MuseData files.
</P>
<P>
The principal difference between MuseData and Humdrum is in the file
organization.
Humdrum represents a full score in a single file, whereas MuseData
represents each part or voice in a separate file.
In translating from MuseData to Kern, each individual part
is first translated to Kern, and then all of the parts are assembled
into a full score.
</P>
<A NAME="Procedural Overview"</A>
<H2>Procedural Overview</H2>
<P>
Although the basic translation to Kern has been automated,
there are several ancilliary problems that must be attended to.
Unfortunately, these ancilliary problems involve the greatest
amount of work.
The translation process is described in detail later in this
document.
The basic steps involved in translating from MuseData to Humdrum
can be summarized as follows.
<ul>
<li> (i)
<i>Accessing</i>
or assembling the necessary MuseData files.
<li> (ii)
<i>Basic translation</i>
from MuseData to the Humdrum Kern representation.
Each part is translated separately.
<li> (iii)
<i>Re-beaming and transposing</i>
any parts for transposing instruments.
<li> (iv)
<i>Assembling a full score</i>
from individual parts.
<li> (v)
<i>Generating figured bass</i>
data (if necessary).
<li> (vi)
<i>Editing</i>
the score to add header information and discard
unneeded data.
Also resolving "backspace" passages, resolving trills
and mordents, checking for naturals, and arranging editorialisms.
<li> (vii)
<i>Adding reference records</i>
to provide "library-type" information about the work.
<li> (viii)
<i>Syntax checking</i>
and proof listening.
<li> (ix)
<i>Adding checksum</i>
information to insure data integrity.
<li> (x)
<i>Assembling the distribution package</i>
including <code>README</code> and <code>LICENSE</code> files.
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The most onerous of the above procedures are automated,
however most of the steps involve manual intervention.
</P>
<A NAME="Procedural Details"</A>
<H2>Procedural Details</H2>
<P>
For data translation, you will normally want to use a UNIX
system.
Data translation can also be carried out under DOS or WINDOWS
but the translation programs will run much slower.
</P>
<P>
In the following detailed explanation, we use the hypothetical
example of translating a work containing four parts:
<i>continuo, 'cello, horn</i>, and <i>oboe</i>.
</P>
<A NAME="1.  Access Appropriate Files."</A>
<H3>1.  Access Appropriate Files.</H3>
<P>
Copy the appropriate files to a convenient working directory
on your hard disk.
Typically, you will need to copy an entire directory structure
containing several subdirectories.
On UNIX systems, use the
<b>cp</b>
command with the
<b>-r</b>
(recursively copy) option.
For example, the following command will copy everything from the `A'
disk to the current directory:
<blockquote>
<code>cp -r a:* .</code>
</blockquote>
You may need to use the
<b>mcopy</b>
command to access DOS disks from Linux systems.
</P>
<P>
On DOS systems you may use the
<b>cptree</b>
command to replicate a subdirectory structure.
</P>
<A NAME="2.  Basic Translation."</A>
<H3>2.  Basic Translation.</H3>
<P>
Change directories in the MuseData file structure
until reaching the parts for a given movement or work.
In our hypothetical example the directory will contain numbered files
from 1 to 4.
Use the
<b>md2kern</b>
program to translate each part separately:
<blockquote>
<code>md2kern 1 > 1.krn
<br>
md2kern 2 > 2.krn
<br>
md2kern 3 > 3.krn
<br>
md2kern 4 > 4.krn</code>
</blockquote>
Each part is now in the Humdrum Kern format.
</P>
<P>
On very rare occasions you may find that
<b>md2kern</b>
fails to work.
This arises from a yet to be diagnosed bug
that seems related to the line-length of input records.
This problem can be overcome by editing the file and
eliminating trailing blanks at the ends of lines.
</P>
<A NAME="3.  Transposing Parts."</A>
<H3>3.  Transposing Parts.</H3>
<P>
Unlike the printed score, the Kern representation encodes
music at concert pitch.
Determine whether any parts are for transposing instruments.
If so, determine how each transposing instrument should be
transposed in order to return it to concert pitch.
For example, a horn in F sounds a perfect fifth below
the notated music.
Use the Humdrum
<b>trans</b>
command to transpose down 4 diatonic letter-names (<code>-d -4</code>)
and transpose down 7 chromatic semitones (<code>-c -7</code>).
(Refer to the <i>Humdrum Reference Manual</i> -- Section 4
for details on how to use this command).
In the case of our horn part:
<blockquote>
<code>trans -d -4 -c -7 3.krn > 3.tra</code>
<br>
<code>mv 3.tra 3.krn</code>     (on UNIX systems)
<br>
<code>ren 3.tra 3.krn</code>     (on DOS systems)
</blockquote>
In the case of a B-flat trumpet or B-flat clarinet,
the appropriate transposition would be:
<blockquote>
<code>trans -d -1 -c -2</code>
</blockquote>
In the case of clarinet in A, use the following transposition:
<blockquote>
<code>trans -d -2 -c -3</code>
</blockquote>
Having transposed the part, edit this file so that
the "transposition interpretation"
designates a transposing <i>instrument</i>
(see <i>Humdrum Reference Manual</i> -- Section 3 for details on
transposition designators).
Simply add the upper-case letter `I' prior to the `T'
in the appropriate tandem interpretation.
In the case of our horn, use a text editor to make the following change:
<blockquote>
<code>*Trd-4c-7</code>
</blockquote>
to:
<blockquote>
<code>*ITrd-4c-7</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="4.  Beam Modification."</A>
<H3>4.  Beam Modification.</H3>
<P>
MuseData and Kern handle beaming information in different ways.
Use the
<b>rebeam</b>
program to transform the beaming data so that it
conforms to the Kern format.
Apply the command to each of the Kern part files:
<blockquote>
<code>rebeam 1.krn > 1.bem
<br>
rebeam 2.krn > 2.bem
<br>
rebeam 3.krn > 3.bem
<br>
rebeam 4.krn > 4.bem</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="5.  Combining Parts."</A>
<H3>5.  Combining Parts.</H3>
<P>
Combining parts entails expanding the files using the
<b>timebase</b>
command,
then amalgamating the part files into a full score using the
<b>assemble</b>
command, and then eliminating null data records using the
<b>rid</b>
command.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand the files, a suitable
<i>time-base</i>
duration must be chosen.
As a minimum, the time-base must not be longer than the shortest
duration note in any of the part files.
The Humdrum
<b>census</b>
command can be used to establish the shortest note:
<blockquote>
<code>census -k *.bem</code>
</blockquote>
Note that triplets or other "n-tuplets" might require
an even shorter time-base for proper score assembly.
For example, if the shortest duration in the work is an eighth-note (`8'),
but the work also contains quarter-note triplets (`12'), then a
common divisor must be sought.
Both 12 and 8 divide evenly into 24, therefore a time-base of 24
is the minimum required.
If you are in doubt about an appropriate time-base value, a "safe"
value is often 96.
Apply the same time-base to each of the part files:
<blockquote>
<code>timebase -t 96 1.bem > 1.tb
<br>
timebase -t 96 2.bem > 2.tb
<br>
timebase -t 96 3.bem > 3.tb
<br>
timebase -t 96 4.bem > 4.tb</code>
</blockquote>
(If you have chosen an inappropriate timebase don't worry too much,
because the
<b>proof</b>
command will complain voluminously when we apply it later.)
</P>
<P>
Now we can assemble the parts into a single file containing
the full score.
Since the Humdrum convention places the lowest parts in the
left-most columns, we must reverse the numerical order of the part files.
We should also use the
<b>rid</b>
command to eliminate null data records:
<blockquote>
<code>assemble 4.tb 3.tb 2.tb 1.tb | rid -d > full.krn</code>
</blockquote>
The file <code>full.krn</code> will now contain a full score rendering
of the work or movement.
</P>
<A NAME="^.  Alignment Check."</A>
<H3>6.  Alignment Check.</H3>
<P>
Now that we have a full score, we ought to check to ensure that the
parts have been correctly aligned.
The formal way of checking this is to run the Humdrum
<b>proof</b>
command, but since we will be running this command later,
and since the likelihood is that everything is okay,
a faster check is simply to ensure that the number of the spines
is constant throughout the file.
We can do this using the
<b>humdrum</b>
command with the
<b>-v</b>
(verbose) option.
<blockquote>
<code>humdrum -v full.krn | grep 'concurrent spines'</code>
</blockquote>
The output from this command will tell us the
<i>minimum</i>
and
<i>maximum</i>
number of spines in the file;
they should be identical.
If they aren't identical, then it is likely that the parts are misaligned.
The probable cause is that one or more of the parts contains
an unusual <i>n</i>-tuplet (such as 7 in the time of a quarter)
and that the time-base value used in the
<b>timebase</b>
command was insufficiently large.
Examine the full score at the point where the parts are misaligned
and determine which duration value that has led to the problem.
Calculate a better time-base value so that all durations in the
work are common factors.
For example, if the work contains quarter-notes (4),
eighth-notes (8) and septuplets in the time of a quarter (28),
then a suitable time-base value would be 28 X 8 or 224.
Return to the section "Combining Parts" and use the revised
time-base value.
</P>
<A NAME="7.  Removing Duplicate Header Information."</A>
<H3>7.  Removing Duplicate Header Information.</H3>
<P>
After creating a full score, duplicate MuseData header comments
can be removed using a text editor like
<b>vi</b>
or
<b>emacs.</b>
For example, if the full score contains 12 parts, we don't
need 12 identical comments indicating the date that the
parts were encoded.
</P>
<A NAME="8.  Eliminate Redundant Section Labels."</A>
<H3>8.  Eliminate Redundant Section Labels.</H3>
<P>
Humdrum provides ways of labelling sections and indicating repeats,
Da Capos, etc.
The
<b>md2kern</b>
program automatically assigns the default label `A' to the first section
in any translated work.
Subsequent sections are labelled `B', `C', etc.
In many cases, the work has only a single section;
in this case the section label is of no use unless there is a repeat.
Consequently, the Humdrum "expansion list" (indicating
how to expand repeats) simply says play section `A' once.
In these cases, both the
<i>section label</i>
and the
<i>expansion list</i>
are redundant and should be deleted.
That is, the following lines should be eliminated if they occur together:
<blockquote>
<code>*>[A]
<br>
*>A</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="9.  Instrument Identification."</A>
<H3>9.  Instrument Identification.</H3>
<P>
Humdrum provides standardized instrumentation indicators.
For example, the standard indicator for "harpsichord"
is <code>*Icemba</code>.
An extensive list of instrument designators can be found in
Section 3 of the
<i>Humdrum Reference Manual</i>
(pp. 193-198).
</P>
<P>
In addition, Humdrum provides standardized instrument class
designators, such as <code>*ICklav</code> for keyboard instruments
and <code>*ICidio</code> for percussion instruments,
and for instrument groupings -- such as <code>*IGripn</code> for
<i>ripieno</i>
instruments and <code>*IGacmp</code> for accompaniment instruments.
These instrument class designators can also be found in
Section 3 of the Humdrum reference manual.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the original instrument name (as found in the score)
should also be encoded as a Humdrum local comment.
</P>
<P>
Add instrument and instrument-class tandem interpretations.
Also add the instrument identification to corresponding local
comments.
</P>
<A NAME="10.  Figured Bass Generation."</A>
<H3>10.  Figured Bass Generation.</H3>
<P>
If the original MuseData score includes figured-bass information,
then the appropriate data will appear in the Kern output as special
global comments (beginning "<code>!!f1</code> ..." or "<code>!!f2</code> ..." etc.).
These comments can be used to generate a Humdrum "basso-numerato"
spine (<code>**Bnum</code>) using the
<b>md2bnum</b>
program.
<blockquote>
<code>md2bnum full.krn > figbass</code>
</blockquote>
This new spine should then be added to the full score using the
<b>assemble</b>
command:
<blockquote>
<code>assemble full.krn figbass > temp
<br>
mv temp full.krn</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="11.  Editing Figured Bass."</A>
<H3>11.  Editing Figured Bass.</H3>
<P>
There is an unfortunate problem arising when translating MuseData
figured bass to the Humdrum basso-numerato.
When a new figure occurs while a bass note is being sustained,
it is possible that the position of the figure in the Humdrum file is incorrect.
Consider, for example, the two passages shown below.
The "<code>5-3</code>" figured bass is positioned
<i>incorrectly</i>
in the first passage,
but it is positioned
<i>correctly</i>
in the second passage:
<blockquote>
<table>
<TR><TD><code>**kern</TD><TD>**kern</TD><TD>**kern</TD><TD>**Bnum</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>.</TD><TD>4B</TD><TD>4g</TD><TD>5 3</code></TD></TR>
</table>
</blockquote>
When more than one figured bass is given for a single bass note the
<b>md2bnum</b>
command cannot determine where the correct placement is from the
MuseData information.
</P>
<P>
The
<b>bnumhelp</b>
program marks all
<i>possible</i>
error points for manual inspection and editing:
<blockquote>
<code>bnumhelp full.krn > new.krn</code>
</blockquote>
Open the file "<code>new.krn</code>" and search for any occurrences of the
string "<code>ERROR?</code>"
Check each possible error points with the original score to
determine whether the figured bass notation is correctly positioned.
When you have finished editing the file:
<blockquote>
<code>mv new.krn full.krn</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="12.  Leading Barlines."</A>
<H3>12.  Leading Barlines.</H3>
<P>
Humdrum tools prefer to have explicit information indicating
the beginning of the first measure.
If a file does not begin with an anacrusis ("pickup")
then an "invisible" first barline needs to be encoded in the Kern
representation.
In our hypothetical file containing five spines,
we would need to insert the following line just before the first
note(s) in the work:
<blockquote>
<table>
<TR><TD><code>=1-<TD></TD>=1-<TD></TD>=1-<TD></TD>=1-<TD></TD>=1-</code></TD></TR>
</table>
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to add the appropriate barline in the figured bass
spine (if it is present).
</P>
<A NAME="13.  Logical and Orthographic Barlines."</A>
<H3>13.  Logical and Orthographic Barlines.</H3>
<P>
The kern representation makes a distinction between the logical
<i>function</i>
of a barline and it's visual or
<i>orthographic</i>
appearance.
For example, kern distinguishes between double barlines whose
function is to indicate the end of a work or movement,
and double barlines that simply delineate sections within the course
of a work or movement.
Moreover, in kern, it is possible for a barline at the
end of the work to be "functionally" a double barline,
yet appear visually as a single barline.
</P>
<P>
<i>Functional double barlines</i>
are encoded with a double equals sign (==) whether or not they
are visually rendered as double barlines.
<i>Functional single barlines</i>
are encoded with a single equals sign (=) whether or not they
are visually rendered as single barlines.
</P>
<P>
The specific visual appearance may be encoded following the equals
sign(s).
The vertical line (|) represents a `thin' line and the exclamation
mark (!) represents a `thick' line.
A typical final double bar would be encoded:
<blockquote>
<code>==|!</code>
</blockquote>
Most mid-movement double bars are encoded with two thin lines
and so would be encoded:
<blockquote>
<code>=||</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<P>
A common translation error arising from the
<b>md2kern</b>
program is to render mid-movement double barlines as
<i>functional</i>
rather than
<i>orthographic</i>
double-bars.
Check all double barlines for proper visual encoding.
Remove "functional" double bars from within the work/movement;
retain only visual double barlines mid-work.
</P>
<A NAME="14.  Eliminating Figured Bass Comments."</A>
<H3>14.  Eliminating Figured Bass Comments.</H3>
<P>
Once the figured bass information has been properly edited,
the associated global comments can be eliminated from the Humdrum file.
Open the file and eliminate all lines beginning with two exclamation
marks followed by the lower-case letter `f'.
For example, execute the following command if using the
<b>vi</b>
text editor:
<blockquote>
<code>:g/^!!f/d</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="15.  Eliminating `P' Record Comments."</A>
<H3>15.  Eliminating `P' Record Comments.</H3>
<P>
Also, eliminate some other MuseData information that has been
echoed as Humdrum comments:
<blockquote>
<code>:g/^!!P/d</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="16.  Resolving backspace Passages."</A>
<H3>16.  Resolving "backspace" Passages.</H3>
<P>
MuseData provides a "backspace" capability that
allows the score pointer to be moved backwards in time.
This is forbidden in Humdrum.
The
<b>md2kern</b>
program marks all occurrences of MuseData backspace material,
and encodes the passage as local comments.
These must be edited by hand.
The user must go back the specified duration and insert
the material either as (1) Kern multiple stops, or as (2) a temporary
split-spine.
If the note durations are identical to the concurrent material in
the same voice, then the backspace material should be inserted
as multiple stops.
If the note durations differ, then a temporary split-spine
must be added.
</P>
<A NAME="17.  Checking Naturals."</A>
<H3>17.  Checking Naturals.</H3>
<P>
The
<b>md2kern</b>
program currently fails to translate all naturals correctly.
Until this bug is fixed, it is necessary to manually check
the output Kern data against the printed score in order to
ensure that all of the naturals are present.
</P>
<A NAME="18.  Adding Heavy Wedge Accents."</A>
<H3>18.  Adding Heavy Wedge Accents.</H3>
<P>
The
"md2kern"
program also currently fails to translate "heavy wedge"
symbols (designated in MuseData by the semicolon ";").
These must be inserted manually as a greve (`) in the
kern data.
</P>
<A NAME="19.  Resolving Trills and Mordents."</A>
<H3>19.  Resolving Trills and Mordents.</H3>
<P>
The Kern representation makes a distinction between whole-tone
and semitone trills and mordents.
Each trill and mordent must be examined manually and the correct code
selected.
</P>
<P>
The
<b>md2kern</b>
command translates all trills using the token "<code>Tt</code>".
Open the file using a text editor and search for occurrences of `Tt'.
Check each trill against the printed score and determine whether
the trill is intended to be a semitone or tone in size.
In rare cases, the size of the trill will be ambiguous.
In these cases choose what you think is the best,
and add the kern `x' signifier immediately following the `T' or `t'.
This indicates that the trill size is an "editorial interpretation."
</P>
<P>
Repeat this same procedure for mordents ("<code>Mm</code>")
and for inverted mordents ("<code>Ww</code>").
</P>
<A NAME="20.  Appoggiaturas."</A>
<H3>20.  Appoggiaturas.</H3>
<P>
The kern representation treats appoggiaturas in a special way.
In general, kern is oriented to representing things in a manner
closer to how they sound.
Consequently, appoggiaturas are encoded as they would be
logically performed.
For example, a quarter-note preceded by an appoggiatura (small note)
would be performed as two eighth-notes.
Similarly, a dotted quarter-note preceded by an appoggiatura
would be performed as a quarter-note followed by an eighth-note.
</P>
<P>
All appoggiaturas must be re-encoded in a
way that reflects their likely performance.
At the same time, the two notes forming the appoggiatura
must be marked in the kern representation:
the initial note of the appoggiatura is marked by the upper-case
letter `<code>P</code>' and the final (second) note of the appoggiatura is
marked by a lower-case letter `<code>p</code>'.
</P>
<A NAME="21.  Section Labels."</A>
<H3>21.  Sections Labels.</H3>
<P>
It is helpful to break-up large works/movements into
smaller sections that can be labelled.
In a binary work, for example, it may be useful to label the `A' and `B'
sections.
In a sonata-allegro work, it may be useful to label the
introduction, exposition, development, recapitulation, etc.
Some works include explicitly notated labels.
These labels may be traditional, e.g. "Coda,"
or they may reflect programatic descriptions,
such as the section entitled
<i>Il canto degl'uccelli</i>
[The song of the birds] in Vivaldi's
<i>The Four Seasons.</i>
</P>
<P>
Where appropriate, suitable section labels should be created
and encoded using the Humdrum Section Label designator.
Section labels can include the space character:
<blockquote>
<code>*>1st Theme</code>
</blockquote>
If you include section labels, you must also include a Humdrum
"Expansion List" to indicate how the sections are
connected.
The Humdrum
<b>thru</b>
command causes a through-composed version of a file to be
generated according to the expansion list.
For example, an expansion list for a simple binary work may be
encoded as:
<blockquote>
<code>*>[A,B]</code>
</blockquote>
Remember that expansion lists ought to be encoded prior
to the first section label.
</P>
<A NAME="22.  Repeats and Da Capos."</A>
<H3>22.  Repeats and Da Capos.</H3>
<P>
Whenever a work/movement includes repeats or Da Capos,
section labels and expansion lists must be encoded.
In some cases, there is more than one way of interpreting
how to realize the repeats.
The most "conventional" realization should be encoded
with the
<i>unnamed expansion list.</i>
This will specify the default expansion using the Humdrum
<b>thru</b>
command.
Suppose for example, that you are encoding a typical
minuet and trio.
The conventional performance practice involves repeating
all sections of both the minuet and trio, but then avoiding
the repeats in the minuet following the Da Capo.
A suitable expansion list might be:
<blockquote>
<code>*>[Minuet,Minuet,Trio,Trio,,Minuet]</code>
</blockquote>
An alternative expansion list might be encoded as follows
(notice the expansion-list-label <i>ossia</i>):
<blockquote>
<code>*>ossia[Minuet,Minuet,Trio,Trio,,Minuet,Minuet]</code>
</blockquote>
</P>
<A NAME="23.  Editorialisms."</A>
<H3>23.  Editorialisms.</H3>
<P>
MuseData files may contain comments that provide
editorial annotations.
Humdrum provides several ways of encoding editorialisms.
These include editorial footnotes, local comments,
global comments, interpretation data,
<i>sic</i>
and
<i>ossia</i>
designations, version labels, sectional labels,
and expansion lists.
</P>
<P>
The kern `<code>x</code>' signifies an "editorial interpretation" -- that the 
immediately preceding signifier is interpreted.
The kern `<code>xx</code>' also signifies an editorial interpretation where the
immediately preceding data token is interpreted.
The kern `<code>X</code>' signifies an "editorial intervention" -- that the
immediately preceding signifier is an editorial addition.
The kern `<code>XX</code>' also signifies an editorial intervention where the
immediately preceding data token is an editorial addition.
The kern `<code>y</code>' designates a invisible symbol -- such as an unprinted
note or rest that is logically implied.
The kern `<code>Y</code>' signifies an editorial
<i>sic</i>
marking -- that the information is encoded literally, but is questionable.
The kern `<code>?</code>' signifies an editorial footnote where the immediately
preceding signifier has an accompanying editorial footnote
(located in a comment record).
The kern `<code>??</code>' signifies an editorial footnote where the immediately
preceding data token has an accompanying editorial footnote
(located in a comment record).

<A NAME="24.  Reference Records."</A>
<H3>24.  Reference Records.</H3>
<P>
Reference information must be added to each file.
This information provides "library-type" information
about the composer, date of composition, place of composition,
copyright notice, etc.
</P>
<P>
As many reference records should be added as possible since
these are immensely useful to Humdrum users.
Essential reference records include the following:

<A NAME="27.  Proof Listening."</A>
<H3>27.  Proof Listening.</H3>
<P>
One of the best ways to ensure that musical data makes sense
is to listen to it.
No data should be released to the public without some proof listening.
The Humdrum
<b>midi</b>
and
<b>perform</b>
commands currently only work under the DOS operating system.
Ensure that you are using DOS when executing the following command:
<blockquote>
<code>midi -c full.krn | perform</code>
</blockquote>
The
<b>perform</b>
command allows you to
<i>pause</i>
(press the space bar), to
<i>move</i>
to a particular measure
(type a measure number followed by enter),
to increase (type <) or decrease (type >) the
<i>tempo,</i>
and to
<i>return</i>
to the beginning of the score
(type enter).
There are many other functions within the
<b>perform</b>
command; refer to the <i>Humdrum Reference Manual</i> -- section 4
for further details.
</P>
<A NAME="28.  Adding VTS Checksum Record."</A>
<H3>28.  Adding VTS Checksum Record.</H3>
<P>
Once you are certain that the score files are completely finished,
you must calculate a "checksum" value to be encoded in a
Humdrum "VTS" reference record.
This record will allow users of the data to check the integrity
of the data using the Humdrum
<b>veritas</b>
command.
</P>
<P>
In order to calculate the checksum value for a given file,
type the command:
<blockquote>
<code>cksum full.krn > temp</code>
</blockquote>
Open the original file:
<blockquote>
<code>vi full.krn</code>
</blockquote>
Go to the bottom of the file by typing `G' and then read in the
checksum value:
<blockquote>
<code>:.r temp</code>
</blockquote>
<P>
Then insert the `<code>!!!VTS: </code>' reference record designator.
