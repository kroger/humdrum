<H1>Representation Assumptions</H1>
<P>
Three principle assumptions underly the Humdrum syntax.
As with all design assumptions, these principles inevitably act as
limitations -- circumscribing what is possible.
</P>
<ul>
<li>
<P>
The first assumption is that the information can be adequately
represented using discrete rather than continuous signifiers.
This is a limitation of all
<i>symbolic</i>
as opposed to
<i>analogic</i>
representations.
If continuous data (such as conducting gestures, or analog sound)
are to be represented using Humdrum, the data must be somehow transformed
into a discrete form.
</P>
<li>
<P>
The second assumption is that information can be meaningfully organized as
ordered successions of data tokens.
More concretely, it is assumed that data can be arranged in linear
<i>spines,</i>
and that these spines are interpretable.
This limitation implies that data tokens can be meaningfully ordered.
Normally,
<i>time</i>
(as in sequences of events), or
<i>space</i>
(as in successive printed signs) provide suitable ordering devices.
However, events that are conceived as entirely independent of one
another are difficult to represent in Humdrum.
</P>
<li>
<P>
The third assumption is that the ASCII character set provides sufficient
richness to act as an appropriate set of signifiers.
In practice, this third assumption proves to be the most limiting.
The use of alphabetic and numeric characters is itself of little concern;
as Saussure pointed out, the choice of symbols is arbitary and conventional.
Of greater concern is the limitation of size.
There are some 128 characters in the basic ASCII set -- not all of
them are printable.
</P>
</ul>
<P>
The size restriction imposed by the ASCII character set might be
circumvented by using binary, pictoral or other signifiers.
However, there are currently significant advantages to using ASCII signifiers.
The principal advantage is that many important software tools
already exist for the manipulation of ASCII text.
The principal disadvantage of ASCII is addressed in Humdrum by allowing
users to recycle the ASCII characters an indefinite number of times --
through the use of new exclusive interpretations.
Note that if all representation schemes use ASCII signifiers,
then any software tool developed for the manipulation of ASCII
text can be applied immediately to any Humdrum representation.
This approach discourages the explosive proliferation of specialized
software (each dealing with a unique representation),
and encourages users to rely on a smaller toolkit consisting
of more generalized and flexible tools.
More precisely, this approach reduces the demands for software development
while maximizing the range of tasks to which a user's skills may be applied.
</P>
<P>
An alternative to Humdrum's provision for multiple representations
would be to provide a single representation,
with greater contextual constraints on the positioning of signifiers.
Unfortunately, high levels of context dependency end up
placing an inordinate burden on software development and use.
Humdrum attempts to simplify software development by minimizing
as much as possible context-dependent meanings for signifiers.
</P>
<H1>Creating New Humdrum Representations</H1>
<P>
The Humdrum syntax provides a framework within which different
music-related symbol-systems can be defined.
Each symbol system or representation
<i>scheme</i>
is denoted by a unique
<i>exclusive interpretation.</i>
There is no restriction on the number of schemes
that can be used or created within Humdrum.
Humdrum users are consequently free to design new representation schemes
that address various needs.
</P>
<P>
Many newly created representation schemes are apt to be
<i>user-specific</i>
-- ways of organizing or representing information that are not likely
to be of much value to other Humdrum users.
In other cases, a well crafted representation scheme will prove to be
of benefit to a wider community of users.
Whether a new Humdrum representation scheme is intended for private use
or for public distribution,
it is prudent to develope good design habits.
There is no such thing as a "perfect" representation,
but it is possible to distinguish poor representations
from better representations.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of considerations involved
in the lucid design of a Humdrum interpretation.
In general, the procedures involved in representation design can
be summarized as follows:
<ol>
<li>
Identify as clearly as possible the goal or goals you hope to achieve
using this new representation.
Formulate a list of questions you expect to be able to answer or address.
<li>
Create a list of the
<i>essential signifieds</i>
(concepts to be represented)
that are needed to pursue the goal(s).
<li>
Make a supplementary list of
<i>related signifieds</i>
that seem peripheral to the immediate goal(s), but might prove
important in pursuing related goals.
<li>
By examining the lists of essential and related signifieds,
try to identify and define the
<i>class</i>
or
<i>classes</i>
of information with which you are dealing.
<li>
Identify whether the signifieds of immediate interest belong
together in a single representation,
or whether they ought to be split into two or more Humdrum interpretations.
<li>
Having established a clearer understanding of the class of signifieds,
trim the previous lists of signifieds to a single list.
<li>
Identify those signifieds that may take many variant forms
(as, for example, musical ornament symbols).
Determine whether these variant forms are
<i>finite, infinite</i>
or
<i>unknown</i>
in number.
If the number is infinite or unknown, a single signifier should be
used -- with provision for an auxilliary representation that can be
used to identify the specific variant form.
<li>
Assign signifiers to all signifieds using the supply
of available ASCII characters.
In general, assign only a single character for each signified.
Using individual ASCII characters as signifiers helps eliminates
context dependency, and so reduces the complexity of the software needed
to process the representation.
<li>
In assigning signifiers to signifieds, try to avoid English language
initialisms (such as Q for quarter-note), since these mappings are poor
mnemonics for non-English-speaking users.
</ol>
</P>
<P>
Some of the "do's" and "dont's" of designing a Humdrum
interpretation can be illustrated by considering a hypothetical
representation problem.
Below, we consider how to design a representation for keyboard fingering.
</P>
<A NAME="Sample_Problem">
<H1>Defining a New Humdrum Interpretation: A Sample Problem</H1>
</P>
<P>
Suppose that we are interested in providing a comprehensive
representation scheme for fingering keyboard instruments.
More concretely, let's suppose that we are interested in studying
the degree of performance difficulty for various keyboard works.
Our
<i>goal</i>
might be to compare the relative difficulty of works
by different composers, or whether a given musical arrangement is
easier to perform than another arrangement.
We might imagine, for example, writing a program which, given
some knowledge of performance constraints, could accept fingering information
as input and produce as output an index of the degree of difficulty.
At a later stage, we might imagine creating an "intelligent"
fingering program that could be used to determine an optimum
way of fingering a particular keyboard passage.
(Such a program might even be designed to take into account the unique
physiological abilities, constraints, or preferences of a given performer.)
In summary, our first research goal would use our "fingering"
representation as an input to some analysis program, whereas our second
research goal might produce the "fingering" representation as output.
</P>
<P>
Having identified the above goals,
our next task is to identify the
<i>essential signifieds</i>
that would be needed to solve these problems.
The most basic information we want to represent includes:
<ol>
<li>
The identity of the finger and hand used in each key-press.
<li>
The identify of the key used in each key-press.
<li>
The order or sequence of key-presses.
<li>
The timing of each activity or movement.
</ol>
</P>
<P>
Having identified what we see as the essential signifieds,
we ought to pause and consider related signifieds that,
although they appear to be peripheral to our goals,
might prove important in pursuing related goals.
By thinking ahead about these other signifieds,
we might avoid future difficulties should we discover that
another item of information proves crucial to our enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Some potential properties or attributes that we might consider representing
could include the following:
<ol>
<li>
The force or velocity with which the key is pressed.
<li>
Whether the hands are crossed -- and if so, which arm is
placed above the other.
<li>
What part of the finger/hand is used to press the key (e.g. knuckles).
<li>
Whether more than one finger is used to press the same key together.
<li>
Whether one (or more) finger is substituted for another finger in the
course of holding a depressed key.
<li>
Whether trills are notated as a precise sequence of finger presses,
or whether they are recorded as generic "trills."
<li>
Whether "Bebung" is used -- that is, whether lateral or
vertical pressure is applied once the key is depressed.
<li>
Whether a second performer can be accommodated
(as in the case of a piano duet).
<li>
Physiological or anatomical attributes of the performer (such as hand-spans).
<li>
Pedalling.
</ol>
A list of related signifieds is rarely likely
to be exhaustive or complete.
So it is important to take time to consider other possible types
of information that relate to keyboard fingering.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stages of designing a Humdrum representation,
it is generally wise to try to formulate a fairly exhaustive
list of possible pertinent attributes.
The purpose of such a list is to ensure that an informed decision is
made regarding those properties we wish to include in the representation,
and those properties we propose to exclude.
More specifically, our goal is to exclude information on the basis of an
explicit decision rather than due to a tacit oversight.
</P>
<P>
Given the above list of potential signifieds,
the next step is to pause and consider the nature of the
<i>class</i>
of information we wish to deal with.
For example, the idea of "pedalling" raises an interesting representation
question.
Are we trying to represent keyboard <i>fingering?</i>
Or is our task the representation of keyboard <i>performance</i>?
Pedalling is obviously part of keyboard performance,
but not something fingers do.
Are we mistaken in thinking that our representation task is limited
to fingering?
Also, since larger arm and body movements are essential aspects of
good performance, should we also consider representing these additional
factors?
</P>
<P>
In light of our goal of measuring performance difficulty,
we would have to admit that pedalling can indeed contribute to the
physical challenge arising from performing a given work.
In terms of our research task therefore, it makes sense to include
pedalling information.
However, we might balk at the prospect of mixing fingering and
pedalling within a single representation -- especially since
some keyboard instruments (e.g. clavichord) have no pedals.
Moreover, the pedals on a piano differ considerably from the
pedals on an organ, although both contribute to overall performance
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
At this point, we are invited to consider whether the various signifieds in
the above list truly belong together in a single
<i>representation,</i>
or whether they ought to be split into two or more Humdrum interpretations.
The above discussion suggests that we might distinguish at least five classes
of information:
<i>performance (broadly construed), fingering, body movement, pedal-boarding</i>
(as on the organ), and
<i>pedalling</i>
(as on the piano or harpsichord).
Moreover, we might define "performance information" as the combination of
fingering plus pedalling or pedal-boarding.
In short, it would make sense to define
<i>three</i>
representations: fingering, pedalling, and pedal-boarding,
and to assume that our program measuring performance difficulty
will accept any combination of one or more of these three classes
of information.
</P>
<P>
Our task has clearly expanded somewhat, since now we need to
consider three types of representation rather than one.
For the purposes of this tutorial example, we might set aside the
problems of representing pedalling and pedal-boarding
and focus on the fingering aspect of keyboard performance.
</P>
<P>
Now that we have a clearer understanding of the class of signifieds,
we can begin to trim the lists of signifieds to a single short list.
We have decided not to represent pedalling using the same
Humdrum interpretation as for fingering.
We might also decide that the fingering activity for a second performer
can be represented using a second independent spine of information.
We might also dispense with representing the force or velocity of
key-depression, and what part of the finger/hand is used to press the key.
We might have decided to represent the fingering for trills,
but not to encode each key-stroke of the trill separately.
We could also decide that representing physiological
attributes of the performer (such as hand-spans) ought to be
left as a separate representation.
Finally, we might have also decided not to represent
<i>Bebung.</i>
This leaves a trimmed list of eight types of signifieds:
<ol>
<li>
The identity of the finger and hand used in each key-press.
<li>
The identify of the key used in each key-press.
<li>
The order or sequence of key-presses.
<li>
The duration of each activity or movement.
<li>
Whether the hands are crossed -- and if so, which arm is
placed above the other.
<li>
Whether more than one finger is used to press the same key together.
<li>
Whether finger substitution occurs.
<li>
The fingering for trills.
</ol>
</P>
<P>
Before going on to map signifiers and signifieds we
need to consider those signifieds that may take variant forms.
What sort of "variations" might appear in a fingering
representation?
An obvious form of variation occurs when alternative fingerings
are possible -- that is, where a passage contains two (or more)
ways of assigning key-presses to different fingers.
Our first task here is to determine whether the number of variant forms
is finite, infinite, or unknown in number.
We can consider this question both at the level of the individual key-press,
and at the level of the entire work.
In the case of the individual key-press, the maximum number of variants
is ten -- since there are no more than ten fingers.
If more than one finger is used to press a key, or if finger-substitutions
occur, then the maximum number of variants is somewhat more than ten --
although still finite in number.
At the level of the entire work, the maximum number of variants is potentially
very large (at least 10 X the total number of key-presses in the work).
Nevertheless, this number remains a finite value for works of finite length.
The question arises, do we want our fingering representation to represent a
single performance of a keyboard passage, or is the representation intended
to represent alternative forms of performance?
</P>
<P>
In order to answer this question we must return once again to
our initial goals.
In analysing the degree of performance difficulty for a work,
we might prefer to analyse a single (actual or plausible) performance.
Measuring the degree of performance difficulty for a
<i>class</i>
of variant performances is apt to prove difficult.
On the other hand, the musical score for a keyboard work may contain no
fingering indications whatsoever.
Therefore it would be wrong to assume that a single fingering specification
would give an accurate indication of the performance difficulty
for a given musical work.
This raises the question of whether our intention is to measure
the performance difficulty of a specific sequence of key-presses
used in a performance, or whether our intention is to measure the
performance difficulty of a particular musical work.
</P>
<P>
As noted above, measuring the difficulty for a class of variant
performances is likely to prove difficult.
There are many many ways of fingering a keyboard work.
Averaging the performance difficulty for the complete class
of possible fingering arrangements would appear silly since most of
these fingerings would be awkward.
One could argue, for example, that the degree of performance difficulty
for a work can be best established by analysing the single most convenient way
of fingering the work.
Alternatively, one could argue that the degree of performance difficulty
for a work can be determined by examining a handful of the most convenient
ways of fingering the work.
Out of the large number of
<i>possible</i>
fingerings, it is only the
<i>plausible</i>
fingerings that really count.
</P>
<P>
Whether our intention is to measure a single fingering sequence or a class of
such fingerings, a helpful question to consider here is where do we
expect to get our fingering data?
Three sources come to mind:
(1) recorded fingering data from an actual performance,
(2) fingerings (including alternatives) notated in printed scores or
annotated by keyboard performers, and
(3) fingering data (including alternatives) generated by a computer program.
In the case of an actual performance, there will be only one fingering.
The other sources can potentially produce more than one fingering at a time.
</P>
<P>
Having identified those attributes that we wish to represent,
we need to consider how the representation ought to be structured.
Specifically, we need to consider how our fingering representation
can be coordinated with other Humdrum interpretations.
The most important coordination task is ensuring that our representation
will correspond well with the core <code>**kern</code> representation.
Each data record in <code>**kern</code> represents a single sonority --
a moment in time that differs from the previous state.
Since key-presses are closely related to notes,
we might want to coordinate each of the <code>**kern</code>
note tokens with possible key-presses.
Many Humdrum pitch-related representations include barlines
-- which are useful markers for coordinating such representations.
This suggests that it might be useful to include barlines
in our fingering representation.
Given both the barline and note-token/key-press correspondences,
we should have little difficulty ensuring that our fingering
representation will be fully coordinated with a number of
other Humdrum representations.
</P>
<P>
We are now ready to consider how to map our signifieds
with a set of appropriate signifiers.
In general, we should endeavor to define one signifier for each attribute.
First, consider how we might identify the individual fingers.
A good system would be to identify each finger by a unique
signifier -- such as a unique decimal integer.
However, there is a long-standing tradition of identifying the
thumb of each hand as the number "1", the index finger by the number "2"
and so on.
Given the limited number of fingers, some context-dependency
may be appropriate here.
In short, we may decide to identify specific fingers through a
<i>ligature</i>
of "hand+finger" -- e.g. left-3 or right-5.
The signifiers "left" and "right" obviously introduce an
English bias.
It would be better to consider more universally recognized
terms such as "mano destra" (MD) and "mano sinistra" (MS).
However, not every user will find these is terms familiar or comfortable.
</P>
<P>
We need not rely on a literalism or initialism.
"Left" and "right" are concepts that lend themselves well to
pictorial representation, so we might consider using
those ASCII characters that convey a left-right pictorial dimension.
Possible contenders would include various letter-contrasts:
<code>d</code> versus <code>b</code>, <code>J</code> versus <code>L</code>;
the three types of parentheses: <code>(</code> versus <code>)</code>, <code>{</code>
versus <code>}</code>, and <code>[</code> versus <code>]</code>;
and the greater-than and less-than signs: <code><</code> versus <code>></code>.
The letter contrasts <code>J</code> versus <code>L</code> are especially poor since
although the angle of the letter <code>L</code></code> is drawn to the right,
"L" implies an initialism for "left" -- and so is apt
to cause confusion.
The parentheses cannot be misconstrued as
literalisms or initialisms, so they are somewhat better signifiers.
However the greater-than and less-than signs are the mostly clearly
arrow-like, and so perhaps provide a better pair of left-right signifiers.
</P>
<P>
Having decided upon the signifiers for left and right,
and having adopted the tradition of numbering the fingers
(1=thumb, 2=index, 3=middle, 4=ring, 5=little),
we could continue mapping signifiers to signifieds,
taking care to minimize context dependency.
</P>
<P>
In reflecting on the above discussion,
readers are apt to feel that one or another type of
information ought to have been included,
or that the signifiers ought to be assigned in a different manner.
Since Humdrum provides a framework within which alternative
representation schemes can be designed,
there is no need to defend a given representation from competing schemes.
Whether an interpretation survives and proliferates will be determined,
not by its conceptual elegance or completeness,
but by whether it is found to have a practical utility in solving
users' problems.
